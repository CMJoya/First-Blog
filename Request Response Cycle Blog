Understanding the purpose of the Request/Response Cycle is useful because it allows us to follow the flow through the App.
Ruby on Rails are many times form based Apps. In a way, the App gives the user a form to submit their information. In turn, 
it stores that data in a Database and the following is a description of how the process works. Essentially, the Router 
receives the users requested information. Then delegates it to the Controller's Action. The Controller receives the request
from the Router. My interpretation of the Controller is that it is the brains of the operation considering that it does a lot
of the work for you to allow the user to view the HTML output. That work entails the Controller delegating the user's request 
to the Model and to the View. Ultimately, gathering the Model and the Views information and rendering it to the user to display 
the HTML. This is a general explanation of what takes place in the Request/Response Cycle. Much more information can be found 
to further explain such an important process between user interaction and application.
